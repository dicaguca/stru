# Stru — Structured Focus System

A lightweight, client-side productivity app for managing tasks and running timed focus sessions. No build step, no backend — just HTML, React, and localStorage.

---

## How it works

Stru runs entirely in the browser. Open `index.html` and the app is live. All data is stored in `localStorage`, so nothing is sent to a server and everything persists between page reloads.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| UI framework | React 18 (loaded via CDN) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS (Play CDN — supports arbitrary values like `bg-[#hex]`) |
| Templating | Babel Standalone (transpiles JSX in the browser at runtime) |
| Routing | Custom hash-based router (`#/home`, `#/session`, etc.) |
| Persistence | `localStorage` |

Because everything is loaded via CDN and transpiled at runtime, there is **no build step** — editing a file and refreshing the browser is all that's needed to see changes.

### Load order matters

`index.html` loads scripts in a strict order:

1. `state.js` — must be first (everything else depends on `window.Stru`)
2. `router.js`
3. `icons.js`
4. All screen files
5. `modals.jsx`
6. `app.jsx` — must be last (mounts the React app)

---

## Key architectural patterns

### Global namespace
Everything is attached to `window.Stru`. Screens register themselves as `Stru.Screens.ScreenName`, modals as `Stru.Modals.ModalName`. `app.jsx` references them all from there.

### State management
`app.jsx` owns the top-level state (tasks, sessions, breaks, active session, etc.) using `usePersistedState` from `state.js`, which wraps React's `useState` and syncs to `localStorage` automatically.

### Priority system
Priorities are defined in `state.js` under `Stru.constants.priorityColors` and `PRIORITY_ORDER`. Each screen (`session.jsx`, `masterlist.jsx`, `plan-session.jsx`, `home.jsx`) has a local copy of the priority map for its own styling — **all copies must be kept in sync** when adding or changing a priority.

Current priority order (high → low):
`must` → `should` → `could` → `personal` → `nice` → `""` (no priority)

### Session timer
The timer is wall-clock based, not tick-counted. `sessionTargetTimeRef` holds an absolute timestamp for when the session ends. Each tick recalculates `Math.ceil((targetTime - Date.now()) / 1000)`. This means the timer is immune to the computer sleeping or going idle — if the machine wakes up after the session should have ended, the duration is capped at the scheduled end time, not the wake time.

## Making changes

Since there's no build step, the workflow is:

1. Edit the relevant `.jsx` or `.js` file
2. Refresh `index.html` in the browser to test
3. Commit and push when happy (see below)

---

## Committing and pushing

### First time on a new machine
If Git throws an SSL certificate error on push, run this once to fix it:
```bash
git config --global http.sslBackend schannel
```

### Normal commit + push
```bash
git add <file1> <file2> ...
git commit -m "Short description of what changed"
git push
```

Or to stage all modified files at once:
```bash
git add -u
git commit -m "Short description of what changed"
git push
```

### If the branch has no upstream yet (first push on a new clone)
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin main
```
